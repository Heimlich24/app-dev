# Snowfall 
Snowfall, the BBC Three show set in Los Angeles in 1983, centres on the start of the crack cocaine epidemic in the US. Leading the cast of characters is 19-year-old Franklin Saint (Damson Idris) and over the course of six series we see him, his family and foes fight over drugs, deals and dollars.

# The Crow
Soulmates Eric Draven and Shelly Webster are brutally murdered when the demons of her dark past catch up with them. Given the chance to save his true love by sacrificing himself, Draven returns to seek bloody revenge against the killers, traversing the worlds of the living and the dead to put the wrong things right.
